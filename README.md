# Maps
## A Yelp-powered Restaurant Recommendation Program

Maps creates a Voronoi diagram visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. This program will segment a specified city or area into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star) and each dot represents a restaurant. The color of the dot is determined by the restaurant's location.
